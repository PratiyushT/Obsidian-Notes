## Principles of OOPS

1. Abstraction: Bother with calling function. Not how functions work.
2. Encapsulation: [[05_Data Hiding|Data Hiding]]
3. [[07_Inheritance/01_Introduction|Inheritance:]] Car accelerator -> Toyota -> Corolla
4. [[08_Polymorphism/01_Introduction|Polymorphism]]: Same name different work

## Class vs Objects
Class -> car then,
Object -> BMW, Mercedes.

**i.e. class is the definition, the blueprint and object is its instance, its implementation.**
