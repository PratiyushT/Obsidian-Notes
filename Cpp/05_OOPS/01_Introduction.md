## Principles of OOPS

1. Abstraction: Bother with calling function. Not how functions work.
2. Encapsulation: Data Hiding
3. Inheritance: Car accelerator -> Toyota -> Corolla
4. Polymorphism: Same name different work

## Class vs Objects
Class -> car then,
Object -> BMW, Mercedes.

**i.e. class is the definition, the blueprint and object is its instance, its implementation.**
