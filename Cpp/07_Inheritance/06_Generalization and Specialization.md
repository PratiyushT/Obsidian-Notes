1. Generalization:
    Example: Suppose a class `Jobs`. Suppose other classes `Engineers`, `Artists,` `Doctor.`
    
    Here we can say job is a generalized term from which we can get engineers, doctors etc. **It is used for grouping.** First the jobs exist then we group it together to get a general class. ==Children are written first==. **Helps us achieve polymorphism as well.**

2. **Specialization**:
    
    Example: A `Rectangle` class. Another class, `Cuboid` derived from rectangles.
    
    Here, At first rectangle class (parent) exists from which we derive a more specific class cuboid with similar but added features. ==Parents are written here==
